Use this extension to translate strings (for example, text messages) written to a Cloud Firestore collection.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a string to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Translates the string into your specified target language(s); the source language of the string is automatically detected.
- Adds the translation(s) of the string to a separate specified field in the same document.

You specify the desired target languages using ISO-639-1 codes. You can find a list of valid languages and their corresponding codes in the [Cloud Translation API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

If the original non-translated field of the document is updated, then the translations will be automatically updated, as well.

#### Multiple collections for translations

To translate through `multiple collections`, it is recommended to install multiple versions of the extension but with a alternative `collection path` for each installation.

There is currently no limit on how many times the extensions can be reinstalled.

#### Multiple field translations

To translate multiple fields, store a map of input strings in the input field:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('translations').add({
  'example one': 'example one',
  'example two': 'example two',
  'example three': 'example three',
})
```
#### Multiple languages

Multiple translations can be defined when setting up the extension `languages` configuration.

The languages are identified using ISO-639-1 codes in a comma-separated list, for example: en,es,de,fr. For these codes, visit the [supported languages list](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).
